## Purpose of this App

This app is designed to provide an interactive 8x8 grid board where users can click on grid cells to toggle their colors. The app also allows users to configure the number of rows and columns in the grid.

## How the Grid and Controller Work

### Grid

The grid is dynamically generated based on the specified number of rows and columns. Each cell in the grid can be clicked to change its color from white to blue and vice versa. The grid also tracks which cells are highlighted (turned blue) and displays their coordinates.

### Controller

The controller allows users to adjust the grid size by specifying the number of rows and columns. Changes in the grid size will reset the grid, and the highlighted cells will be cleared.
